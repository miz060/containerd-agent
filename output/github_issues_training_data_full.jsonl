Additionally, certain Go compiler flags like '-trimpath' can introduce further conflicts. These limitations make Go's plugin system unreliable for production environments.\n\nTo overcome these challenges, there are two recommended approaches: \n\n1. **Build a Custom Containerd Binary**: You can include your custom plugin directly within the containerd source tree and build a new containerd binary. This approach ensures compatibility as the plugin and containerd core share the same dependency versions. For example, you can use tools like 'vendor' to include the containerd core in your project and develop your plugin as part of the integrated binary. While this approach is reliable, it requires ongoing maintenance to keep the custom binary up-to-date with upstream containerd changes.\n\n2. **Use Remote Plugins**: Remote plugins are implemented as separate processes that communicate with containerd over gRPC. They provide better compatibility and isolation because they do not depend on the internal structure of the containerd binary. However, not all plugin types currently support remote implementations. For instance, task plugins in containerd are in-process and do not yet have remote plugin support. In such cases, developers may need to fork containerd to extend support for remote plugins or work within the existing plugin framework to align with their use case.\n\nUltimately, choosing between these approaches depends on the specific requirements of the system and the level of effort the development team is willing to invest in maintaining customizations."}], "metadata": {"source": "github_issue", "issue_number": 5241, "issue_title": "Supporting remote plugin for tasks etc.", "issue_type": "feature", "priority_score": 5.5}}

Misconfigurations might cause layers to be unpacked to the default snapshotter.\n\n2. **Disable Aggressive GC**: If GC is suspected, verify and adjust containerd's GC settings to avoid premature cleanup of content. For example, setting `discard_unpacked_layers = false` helps prevent layer removal.\n\n3. **Implement Recovery Logic**: As a temporary workaround, implement logic that attempts to repull missing content. For instance, a patch that retries pulling the image when a 'not found' error occurs can help recover affected pods. Ensure this logic considers authentication and rate-limiting constraints.\n\n4. **Monitor and Debug**: Use `ctr` commands to inspect the content store and snapshotter states when the issue arises.

Use `journalctl -u containerd` and check the Harbor server logs for detailed insights.\n\nBy following these steps, you can ensure that containerd is correctly configured to interact with your private registry, minimizing issues with authentication, TLS, and image layer retrieval."}], "metadata": {"source": "github_issue", "issue_number": 10749, "issue_title": "pull images: ctr: failed to copy: httpReadSeeker: failed open: could not fetch content descriptor sha256:a8a17b930da0e18bdc5a34f629fb529b877a441a5a2b0a305121fbd3ab20712b (application/vnd.docker.image.rootfs.diff.tar.gzip) from remote: not found", "issue_type": "bug", "priority_score": 5.1}}

This goes against the principle of minimizing dependencies in shim design, which is crucial for maintaining modularity and reducing the attack surface in container runtimes. Shim processes are intended to act as lightweight intermediaries between containerd and the container runtime. Introducing gRPC unnecessarily ties the shim to the API package's implementation details, potentially causing bloated binaries and maintenance challenges.\n\nTo address this issue, the recommended approach is to decouple the gRPC dependency from the API package by abstracting the client interface. For example, containerd could rely on code generation tools like `protobuf` to generate interfaces that are independent of specific transport mechanisms like gRPC. This approach enables the shim to interact with containerd without directly importing gRPC, adhering to best practices for modular and extensible runtime design.

The 'subject' field in referrer manifests introduces a reverse reference, meaning that objects referring to a particular subject should prevent that subject from being deleted. To achieve this, the following practices are recommended: \n\n1. **GC Labeling for Subject Relationships**: Use GC labels to define the relationship between the subject content and its referrers. For example, a referrer manifest can have a label pointing to the subject it references, ensuring that the subject is retained until the referrer is explicitly deleted.\n\n2. **Handling Sparse Content Stores**: Containerd's content store is 'sparse', meaning content may not always exist locally. To manage referrers that point to non-existent content, consider implementing leases or temporary tags to retain referrer content until its subject arrives.\n\n3. **Lost Update Problem**: When multiple processes modify referrer metadata (e.g., appending to the subject field), there is a risk of overwriting updates. To mitigate this, ensure atomic operations or use a mechanism to merge updates without data loss.\n\n4. **Push and Pull Flow Optimization**: During image pull or push operations, ensure the system can handle subject fields without requiring immediate resolution of their relationships.

For example, an annotation like `cdi.k8s.io/sandbox_device: vendor.com/XPU=0` can be used to pass data about allocated devices to the runtime backend (e.g., Kata Shim). This method ensures that the backend is aware of the resource allocations at the sandbox creation stage.\n\n2. **Sandbox-Level Resource Aggregation**: During the `CreateSandbox` phase, aggregate the resource allocations for all containers within the Pod (including init and sidecar containers). This information is then passed to the runtime backend to appropriately size resources such as CPU, memory, and PCIe topology for the VM.\n\n3. **Avoid Early Execution of Device-Specific Configurations**: At the sandbox creation stage, avoid invoking `WithCDI` or similar device-specific configurations. This ensures that the runtime backend retains the flexibility to allocate resources without prematurely resolving container-specific details.\n\n4. **Translation During Container Creation**: During the `CreateContainer` call, map the CDI annotations from the sandbox phase to the specific Linux device configurations required by the runtime backend. This allows for device attachment (e.g., hot-plug or cold-plug) only after the required resources have been pre-allocated at the sandbox level.\n\n5. **Follow Best Practices for Compatibility**: Ensure that the implementation aligns with containerd's architecture and uses extensible mechanisms like annotations to avoid breaking changes or tight coupling with specific runtimes.\n\nBy adopting this pattern, you can effectively handle complex resource allocation scenarios across multiple containers in a Pod and ensure that the runtime backend (e.g., Kata) has sufficient information to correctly size and allocate VM resources upfront."}], "metadata": {"source": "github_issue", "issue_number": 10282, "issue_title": "Pass-through resource allocations from runtime-config (CRI) to oci-spec", "issue_type": "feature", "priority_score": 2.5}}

Ensure to call the `cancel()` function in a `defer` statement to release resources associated with the context.\n\n2. **Pass the timeout context to `task.Exec`:** When calling `task.Exec`, use the timeout-enabled context. This allows the execution of the task to be bound by the specified timeout.\n\n3. **Handle cancellation gracefully:** After starting the process and waiting for it to complete, check the error or exit status. If the timeout is exceeded, the context will cancel the task, and you should handle the cancellation appropriately.\n\n4. **Proper cleanup:** Ensure that the task is stopped and deleted if it times out. This avoids leaving dangling resources in the container runtime.\n\nHere\u2019s an example implementation:\n\n```golang\nctx := namespaces.WithNamespace(context.Background(), \"my-namespace\")\nimage, _ := client.GetImage(ctx, myImage)\n\ncontainer, _ := client.NewContainer(\n    ctx,\n    \"container-id\",\n    containerd.WithNewSnapshot(\"snapshot-id\", image),\n    containerd.WithNewSpec(oci.WithImageConfig(image)),\n)\n\ntask, _ := container.NewTask(ctx, cio.NewCreator(cio.WithStreams(nil, io.Discard, io.Discard)))\nspec, _ := container.Spec(ctx)\nspec.Process.Args = []string{\"sleep\", \"60\"}\n\ntaskContext, cancel := context.WithTimeout(ctx, 15*time.Second)\ndefer cancel()\n\nps, _ := task.Exec(taskContext, \"test-sleep\", spec.Process, cio.NewCreator(cio.WithStdio))\nch, err := ps.Wait(taskContext)\nif err != nil {\n    panic(err)\n}\n\nerr = ps.Start(taskContext)\nif err != nil {\n    panic(err)\n}\n\nec := <-ch\nif ec.ExitCode() != 0 {\n    if errors.Is(taskContext.Err(), context.DeadlineExceeded) {\n        fmt.Println(\"Task timed out and was canceled.\")\n        task.Kill(ctx, syscall.SIGKILL)\n        task.Delete(ctx, containerd.WithProcessKill)\n    } else {\n        fmt.Printf(\"Task failed with error: %v\", ec.Error())\n    }\n}\n```\n\n### Key Points:\n- Use `context.WithTimeout` to define the maximum duration for the task execution.\n- Always clean up resources using `task.Kill` and `task.Delete` to avoid resource leaks.\n- Check for `context.DeadlineExceeded` to determine if the timeout was the reason for the task cancellation.\n\nThis pattern ensures robust handling of timeouts and proper cleanup in containerd task management."}], "metadata": {"source": "github_issue", "issue_number": 8155, "issue_title": "Task Exec Timeout via Context", "issue_type": "feature", "priority_score": 2.5}}

For instance:\n\n1. **Scenario 1 (t1 vs t2)**: When a client (t1) attempts to create a sandbox and encounters a failure, it may proceed to delete the sandbox task. Simultaneously, the controller (t2) listening for task exit events might clean up the sandbox prematurely, leading to a 'not found' error during the cleanup. To address this, ensure proper synchronization mechanisms, such as mutex locks, to prevent premature or duplicate cleanup.\n\n2. **Scenario 2 (t2 vs t3)**: When a client (t3) explicitly removes a sandbox, it may trigger a stop operation (StopSandbox) concurrently with t2's task exit event handling. This can cause multiple kill operations to overlap, resulting in errors like 'ttrpc closed'. Mitigation involves structuring operations to avoid overlapping task kill calls, potentially using state checks or locks.\n\n3. **Scenario 3 (Multiple Wait and Kill)**: As described in issue #11954, repeated wait and kill operations can occur due to I/O delays or kubelet retries.

For example, runc relies on tools like 'socat' on the host to handle bidirectional data redirection for port-forwarding. However, Kata Containers and gVisor use lightweight virtual machines or sandboxed environments that make direct host dependencies less practical. \n\nTo address this, a generalized solution involves executing a utility (e.g., 'wincat.exe' or similar) inside the sandbox or pause container. This removes the need for host-level dependencies. Best practices include:\n\n1. **Runtime Configuration Options**: Introduce configurable options such as `PortforwardExecCmd` (to specify the command for port-forwarding) and `SandboxImage` (to define the sandbox image to include the utility).\n\n2. **Sandbox Design**: Modify the pause container to include port-forwarding utilities like 'socat' or similar tools. This approach reduces the burden on the host but requires careful resource management, such as adjusting OOM scores to ensure the stability of the pause container.\n\n3. **Ephemeral Containers**: Leverage Kubernetes' Ephemeral Containers API to run debug or utility containers for port-forwarding dynamically. This avoids modifying the sandbox image but requires additional lifecycle management.\n\n4. **Resource Management**: When embedding utilities into the pause container, ensure memory and resource isolation. For example, set higher OOM score adjustments for utility processes to prevent destabilizing the main pause process.\n\n5. **Collaboration with Kubernetes**: Work with upstream Kubernetes to standardize solutions, such as adding port-forwarding capabilities to the default Kubernetes pause image. This ensures broader compatibility across runtimes.\n\nUltimately, the choice between extending the pause container, using ephemeral containers, or modifying runtime APIs depends on the trade-offs in complexity, resource management, and runtime isolation requirements.

Furthermore, plugins handling volume mounts or resources often lead to resource bloat as they are not tightly coupled with the container lifecycle. To address these issues, the proposed design changes include: 1) tracking mounts as garbage-collected resources to ensure proper cleanup; 2) introducing a custom mount handler framework to manage diverse mount types; and 3) implementing a centralized manager interface in containerd for performing mounts, while allowing system-level mounts to pass through.

In the case of AWS ECR, the limit is typically 10 PutImage requests per second. To handle these errors effectively in containerd, you can implement an exponential backoff strategy during retries. Exponential backoff involves progressively increasing the wait time between retries after receiving a '429 Too Many Requests' response. This approach minimizes the risk of aggravating rate limits and allows the registry to recover from overload. In containerd's code, you can modify the retry mechanism in the `resolver.go` file to include sleep intervals with backoff. For example, after detecting the '429 Too Many Requests' status, you can introduce a delay of N seconds, doubling the delay with each subsequent retry until a maximum limit is reached.

Once the checkpoint is created, it can be imported and restored as needed.\n\n2. **Modifying containerd for compatibility with CRI-O's checkpoint format:** This approach would require changes to containerd to support the checkpoint image format used by CRI-O. This option might be more complex and require upstream contributions to containerd.\n\nThe recommended approach depends on the specific use case. If you are already using tools compatible with containerd's native checkpoint format, the first option is more straightforward and aligns with containerd's architecture. On the other hand, if interoperability with CRI-O is critical, you might consider contributing code to enhance containerd's compatibility.\n\nIt is also worth noting that a prototype for restore functionality in containerd has been proposed (e.g., PR #10365 in the containerd repository). Keeping track of such developments and participating in discussions within the containerd community can help ensure the solution aligns with ongoing improvements in the ecosystem."}], "metadata": {"source": "github_issue", "issue_number": 10093, "issue_title": "Add support for container restore from a checkpoint in Kubernetes", "issue_type": "feature", "priority_score": 1.6}}
