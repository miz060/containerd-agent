StopContainer and RemoveContainer are 'post-hook' events where plugins get notified but cannot prevent the action. StopContainer can happen actively via external request or by container process exiting/crashing, so plugins cannot prevent it. RemoveContainer is semantically like a post-hook - plugins cannot prevent removal but can perform local bookkeeping actions."

    "question": "Is there a way to start a pod without a pause container? Or to make the pause container use one runtime and the main container in the pod use another runtime? I have my own runtime that does some low-level local tasks (doesn't require networking and would only deploy a single container at a time) which works fine with containerd but if I try to use it in an orchestration setup like k3s/k8s, every pod has a sandbox/pause container in addition to my own. The pause container won't be able to run due to the nature of my runtime. I'm looking for either: 1) Run pause container with runc and mine with my runtime (but this isn't possible since every pod needs to use the same runtime), 2) Disable the pause container entirely, or 3) Change the CRI config to use a dummy empty container as sandbox_image.",

The Sandbox API allows replacing the pause container with your own implementation by implementing CRI.SandboxCreate/Start/Delete in your runtime. This provides a way to have custom sandbox behavior while maintaining CRI compatibility."

Containerd has a shim server to export metrics and the cgroups package defines protobuf for RPC calls. It's not good to add an extra layer to use runc's cgroups package, and runc plans to move all those packages to internal so no one can use them. For containerd, they focus on reading operations, so it's easier to maintain a small, focused package."
